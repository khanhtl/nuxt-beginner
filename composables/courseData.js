                    In this lesson, we learn how to setup VS Code with the Volar extension. Volar provides support for working with TypeScript in single file components, as well as other Vue features.

                    We also learn how to setup Volar’s take over mode to get imports of .vue files in .ts files working without running 2 TypeScript language services in VS Code.
